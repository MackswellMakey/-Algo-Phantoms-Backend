## Deadline to save gas

When issuing a multicall transaction with multiple steps, 

if the first step doesn't check a deadline but later steps do then the transaction will unnecessarily burn a large amount of gas and then revert.

Steps to Reproduce
etherscan.io/tx/0x6da942398b522165efe28432259ff67606f615852fe6de5da7fb11cdc6262cfe
Notice that this is a multicall with:

createAndInitializePoolIfNecessary
mint
refundETH
createAndInitializePoolIfNecessary costs over 4,000,000 gas and has no deadline check.
mint has a deadline checked that is checked as one of the very first things it does.

Expected Behavior
Any transaction with a deadline will check the deadline first, and fail out immediately without wasting much gas.
